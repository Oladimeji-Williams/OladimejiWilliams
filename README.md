This repository highlights some of the Data Science projects I have completed in my career until now. They are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

# PROJECT 1: 
  **[HR Analytics Classification]** _(https://github.com/Oladimeji-Williams/HRAnalyticsClassification)_
  * This project helps to determine which employee should be promoted by looking at a few factors set by an
organisation - a process faster than if HR human personnel were do it, with fewer errors.
  * Built a client facing API using **_flask_**
  * This project is live on **[Heroku]** _(https://hr-analytics-classification.herokuapp.com)_

# PROJECT 2:
  **[Bank Data]** _(https://github.com/Oladimeji-Williams/Data-Science-ML-With-AiLeadTech)_
  * In this project, you fill find solutions to all the practice questions on Python when I started learning Python programming language for Data Science. It also contains a very short analysis of a [Bank Data] on here _(https://github.com/Oladimeji-Williams/Data-Science-ML-With-AiLeadTech/blob/main/bankdata_new.ipynb)._
